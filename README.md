		cd
		and then typing:
		ls
		in Linux
	
1. Create a .bashrc in home directory, if one does not yet exist. 
2. Add the following to that file (in VI or other editor): 

        alias camel='python {insert absolute path of camelConvert.py script}'
	
	
3. Restart Linux terminal, and try typing in camel to the terminal and pressing enter. Cheers!
