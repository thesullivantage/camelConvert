# Camel Convert Script

## To use with Git Bash (Or other Linux kernel)

0. Copy the camelConvert.py script to wherever is convenient (hopefully somewhere near your home directory.
	- A Helpful note is that your home directory can be found with: 
	cd
	and then typing:
	ls
	in Linux
1. Create a .bashrc in home directory, if one does not yet exist.
2. Add the following to that file (in VI or other editor): 
        alias camel='python {insert absolute path of camelConvert.py script}'

3. Type camel [./filename] in your command line after arestarting bash (or sourcing .bashrc immediately)

4. Enjoy your filenames without spaces! Cheers!
